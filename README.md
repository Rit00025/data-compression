# Data Compression
The implementation of various compression techniques.


Hello all the readers, this is my new repository which consists of the implementation of the various data compression techniques that I'll be learning in the upcoming months.

I like to code in Python, so every code that I'll put up here will be in python (sorry if you don't code in it, but can't help itðŸ˜œ). Anyways, along the time when I'll be commiting more such techniques after implementing them, I'll update this section with the contents. 

The subfolders carry the name of the technique and within each subfolder there is the code. I'll not tell you how they work. Because all the implementations are very easy and you can easily find out what is going on and how is it working. 

This repository will be updated every one or two weeks.

Till date(06/10/2020), most of the techniques, I've learnt over the period of one month consists of losless compression techniques and most of them are used to encode strings. The same can be used for text files, with minor modification requirements. The techniques are:
1. Huffman Coding
2. Run Length Encoding
3. Golomb Coding
4. Tunstall Coding
